  - title: Allosteric Drug Design Targeting DNMT1 Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) 
    company: Center for Systems Biology, Department of Bioinformatics, School of Biology and Basic Medical Sciences, Soochow University
    company_url: 'http://jysw.suda.edu.cn/'
    company_logo: images/suzhou_Jysw.png
    location: Suzhou, China
    date_start: '2020-05-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Construct the biological network of the complex, and develope indicators that quantitatively characterize the characteristics of the mutant residues
        * Predict the allosteric site and allosteric path of the complex based on perturbation response scanning (PRS) analysis
        * Explore pocket information in the trajectory of DNMTs, evaluate their targetability, and determine potential allosteric sites combining mutation information.

  - title: Structural and Functional Analysis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Disease Modules
    company: Center for Systems Biology, Department of Bioinformatics, School of Biology and Basic Medical Sciences, Soochow University
    company_url: 'http://jysw.suda.edu.cn/'

    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Obtain the NSCLC-related disease network module from the pre-omics analysis.
        * Carry out research in five aspects, including functional enrichment analysis, structural modeling of protein interactions, mapping of mutation and post-translational modification information and druggability based on drug pockets.
        * Verify the pathogenic function of the NSCLC network module at the two levels of pathway and structure.
