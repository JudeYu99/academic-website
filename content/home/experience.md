    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Construct the biological network of the complex, and develope indicators that quantitatively characterize the characteristics of the mutant residues
        * Predict the allosteric site and allosteric path of the complex based on perturbation response scanning (PRS) analysis
        * Explore pocket information in the trajectory of DNMTs, evaluate their targetability, and determine potential allosteric sites combining mutation information.
