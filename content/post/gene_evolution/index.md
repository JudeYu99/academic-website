## Overview

1. Origin of new genes
2. Evolution of essential genes and development

## New Genes Definition & Influence on Evolution of Species

- Defined by **Prof. Manyuan Long**, there are two aspects of the definition of new genes:

	1.	First, it refers to those genes produced at a relatively recent stage in the evolutionary process, these newly produced genes are new genes. By relatively recent stages in the evolutionary process which usually refers to 50,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago, one million years ago, etc., they are very short time scales. 
	2.	The second aspect is relative to those very old genes, such as those genes that control translation or transcription which could be produced one hundred million years ago. Those genes have multiplied themselves and can generate new copies. These copies, relative to old genes, are new genes. 

- The significance of their evolution is also that the gene is the genetic basis that controls the evolution of the life. So, because of the production of new genes, it’s the same as changing the information of the genetic basis of the controlling organism. As such, it has extraordinary evolutionary meaning.


- The birth and death of genes are generally important process in evolution and biology.
- Difference in the concept of new gene made from the traditional theory of molecular biology and evolution
	1.	The classic model of "mutation come and go".		-- _Hermann Muller_
	2.	Important genes must be functionally conserved.		-- _Francois Jacob & Ernest Mayr_
	3.	Applied to development: Genetic basis of development is conserved.		-- _Sean Carroll (2004) & Stephen J Gould (2003)_

- New genes
	1.	The genes evolve as morphology and phenotypes do.
	2.	The new gene drive evolution of genetic basis underlying morphology and phenotypes. (e.g. developmental process and reproductive process)



## Theory of Ancient Origination of Essential Functions

-	-- _Francois Jacob, 1977. Evolution and tinkering. Science: 196: 1161-1166_

	1.	Novelties come from previously unseen association of old material. To create is to recombine. Evolution does not produce novelties from scratch.

	2.	The really creative part in biochemistry must have occurred very early. But it is not biochemical novelties that generated diversification of organisms.

- It is impossible for nature to produce brand new genes.
- The most important part of biochemistry has been formed at the early stage of the origin of life. Nowadays, it is impossible for nature to produce important new biochemical functions.
- "Essential genes are not organism specific, nor are their functions protected by gene duplication." –- _Michael Ashburner et al, 1999. Genetics_



## Focus on New Genes

- Nature -- _How evolution builds genes from scratch_  
	Focused news feature article reported and discussed new gene evolution research.
- Science -- _New Genes in Drosophila Quickly Become Essential_  
	New genes produce essential functions as well as old ones.
- Elife -- _Innovation of heterochromatin functions drives rapid evolution of essential ZAD-ZNF genes in Drosophila_
- _Frequent Recent Origination of Essential Genes in Drosophila_  
	-> Sexual Conflict Paradox in New Gene Evolution:   
	A new gene cannot simultaneously meet the needs of male and female; when it favors male, it hurts female; when it favors female, it hurts male. 


## Imperfect Features of Genes & Impacts of Human Society

Up till now, Long et al. have observed that
1.	First, genes that concern sexual differentiation and evolution produced by new genes are often imperfect in its functions. This means that is has a more beneficial function for one sex, often at the expense of the functional significance of the other sex. This is the first type of imperfection.
2.	The second type is one people have found in the maternal line. For example, the genes of the mitochondria and the gene from the nucleus of the paternal line often do not match perfectly, creating descendants with a proper performance than both their parents. Furthermore, they suspect it is very likely that these genes have an impact on human behavior, also creating imperfection in this respect. So, in this sense, genes influence our most general perception of human behavior, and even some medical considerations.



## Inspiration and Outstretch

- New genes and new functional mutant genes belong to the new functional genetic information that is constantly generated during the dynamic evolution of the genome.
- Dr. Jianhai Chen summarized the relationship between evolution and biology as following:  
Biology is a sub-discipline of evolutionary science. Many people think that evolutionary science is a branch of biology, but the truth seems to be the opposite one. Evolution covers a much broader range, obviously. Organisms that do not conform to the laws of evolution do not exist, or have been eliminated or are about to be eliminated. Neither does an environment that does not conform to the laws of biological origin. With the idea of evolution, many questions can be thought through more thoroughly.
- Identification of the origin of new genes.  
	It is currently believed that there are at least 12 structural evolution patterns for new genes:
	1.	Reverse transcription (RNA originated novel genes);
	2.	Exon shuffling, DNA duplication, gene fusion, frameshift mutation, alternative splicing, non-coding RNA mutation, pseudogene RNA regulator (DNA originated novel genes)；
	3.	De Novo new genes, etc.
