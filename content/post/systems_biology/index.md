Systems biology is the computational and mathematical analysis and modeling of complex biological systems. It is a biology-based interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism) to biological research.

Particularly from the year 2000 onwards, the concept has been used widely in biology in a variety of contexts. The Human Genome Project is an example of applied systems thinking in biology which has led to new, collaborative ways of working on problems in the biological field of genetics. One of the aims of systems biology is to model and discover emergent properties, properties of cells, tissues and organisms functioning as a system whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques of systems biology. These typically involve metabolic networks or cell signaling networks. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology)).

Systems biology is a new model of biological research that has emerged as we become able to carry out high-throughput and global research on the components and interactions of organisms. It tries to differentiate from the reductionist biology research model of the past 100 years, and to develop an overall description of the life system. In addition to emphasizing the overall and network nature of this new biological research model, it also emphasizes the use of mathematical and quantitative means to understand life systems. The current systems biology is mainly derived from genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and other omics research, so research is still carried out at the molecular level, but systems biology must be improved to the level of organizations and individuals in order to be regarded as true systems biology study. The future of systems biology must focus on revealing and refining quantitative theories in life systems and the prediction of biological phenotypes. For example, can big data such as the network of biomolecule interactions, genomes, and proteomes be linked to the physiological functions and phenotypes of individual organisms? Can such high-throughput information and big data clearly reveal the evolutionary rules between biological populations? Can we understand the rules of individual development and even the occurrence of diseases from such networks and big data? If such questions cannot be answered, the so-called systems biology may still have not departed from the scope of reductionism, but has only expanded in scale.
