In recent years, the application of proteomics technology has achieved rapid development, and high-level research results are surging and emerge in endlessly. In 2020 alone, the top international journal Cell, Nature has published a total of 75 research results related to proteomics and protein modification technologies, including 9 high-level academic results related to COVID-19, which provided great value for the development of clinical treatment programs.

On January 9, 2021, **Tiannan Guo**’s team from the School of Life Sciences of West Lake University and **Yu Hu**'s team from Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology jointly published the title _Multi-organ Proteomic Landscape of The latest research paper on COVID-19 Autopsies_ reported a panoramic view of protein pathology in multiple organ tissue samples from patients who died of COVID-19 in early 2020. For the first time, the study conducted a detailed and systematic analysis of the response of multiple key organs after the infection at the protein molecular level, providing clues and basis for formulating treatment plans, developing new drugs and treatment methods.

The research team collected 7 different organ tissue samples (lung, spleen, liver, heart, kidney, thyroid, and testis, n=144) from 19 patients who died of COVID-19 and 56 non-COVID-19 patients. A total of 74 tissue samples were used as controls, and TMT-labeled proteomics technology was used for systematic analysis to draw a panoramic view of multiple organ protein molecules in patients who died of critically ill COVID-19.

The study quantified a total of 11,394 proteins, of which 5,336 were significantly changed in at least one organ of COVID-19 patients. Disorders of protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism have also been detected in multiple organs. Proteomics data shows that after SARS-CoV-2 infection, it may cause excessive inflammation, which in turn causes the destruction of the gas exchange barrier in the lungs, which leads to hypoxia and angiogenesis in the lungs, kidneys, spleen, liver, heart, and thyroid or even coagulation and fibrosis.

The research team further systematically analyzed the physiological functions, pathological morphology and proteomics characteristics of various organs. The results showed that a number of lung proteins have changed, mainly including proteins those related to virus proliferation, involved in the pathological process of pulmonary fibrosis, and degradation of viral restriction factors. The lungs and spleen showed the up-regulation of immune checkpoint proteins and the down-regulation of T cell enriched proteins as molecular features of adaptive immune response suppression, and the decrease of T and B lymphocytes in the spleen also confirmed this molecular feature.

From the clinical pathology point of view, although only substantial fibrotic lesions have occurred in the lungs, proteomics results show that signs of tissue fibrosis have also been observed in organs such as the liver and kidneys. It reminds us that we need to prevent and intervene in the possible sequelae of multiple organ fibrosis for the critically ill patients who have recovered.

In response to previously reported pathological changes such as seminiferous tubule damage, Leydig cell reduction, and mild lymphocytic inflammation in the testis of patients who died from COVID-19, proteomics data further explored the specific mechanisms. The study found 10 proteins that have significantly changed in the testis tissue of patients with COVID-19. Their functions are closely related to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, the reduction of sperm activity, and the reduction of Leydig cell-specific markers.

It is worth mentioning that for the ACE2 protein, the culprit of the SARS-CoV-2 entering the human body, the research team found that there is no significant difference in the number of different types of organs in patients compared with non-coronavirus patients. On the contrary, cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps viruses enter cells, has increased significantly in the lungs of patients. This suggests that ACE2 is only a channel for the novel coronavirus to enter the human body, but CTSL may be a potential therapeutic target to block virus invasion.

To sum up, the study described the multi-organ proteomics profile of patients who died from COVID-19, revealed multiple newly discovered protein changes and biological processes, and provided new clues for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Of course, these studies are based on tissue samples from patients who died from the new crown. Whether the same changes will occur in mild and severe patients, and whether such changes are reversible, still needs further research.
