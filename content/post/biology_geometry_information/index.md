### Introduction

Biological organisms live in a complex environment, while being promoted and restricted by the environment. For example, in a three-dimensional geometric space, the one-dimensional linear structure of DNA is more conducive to information storage and reading, while folding into a three-dimensional structure is crucial for the regulation of gene transcription. In order to adapt to this complexity, the key principle of life is that as long as the environment can provide, it will not be manufactured by the system itself, but will form a complex network of different levels, allowing one process to regulate and control other processes, relying on the complex environment Born. For example, animals externalize the production of vitamins and only store information on how to obtain food containing vitamins; actively use the gravity of the earth; originally independent mitochondria are incorporated into eukaryotic cells for metabolism.

In June 2021, mathematician **JÃ¼rgen Jost**, director of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Germany, published an article _Biology, Geometry and Information_, which explored the basic role of mathematics, especially geometry, on the complex systems of life.
