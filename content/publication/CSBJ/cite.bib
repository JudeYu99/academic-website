abstract = {DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), a large multidomain enzyme, is believed to be involved in the passive transmission of genomic methylation patterns via methylation maintenance. Yet, the molecular mechanism of interaction networks underlying DNMT1 structures, dynamics, and its biological significance has yet to be fully characterized. In this work, we used an integrated computational strategy that combined coarse-grained and atomistic simulations with coevolution information and network modeling of the residue interactions for the systematic investigation of allosteric dynamics in DNMT1. The elastic network modeling has proposed that the high plasticity of RFTS has strengthened the correlated behaviors of DNMT1 structures through the hinge sites located at the RFTS-CD interface, which mediate the collective motions between domains. The perturbation response scanning (PRS) analysis combined with the enrichment analysis of disease mutations have further highlighted the allosteric potential of the RFTS domain. Furthermore, the long-range paths connect the intra-domain interactions through the TRD interface and catalytic interface, emphasizing some key inter-domain interactions as the bridges in the global allosteric regulation of DNMT1. The observed interplay between conserved intra-domain networks and dynamical plasticity encoded by inter-domain interactions provides insights into the intrinsic dynamics and functional evolution, as well as the design of allosteric modulators of DNMT1 based on the TRD interface.}
