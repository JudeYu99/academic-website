Yu Zhu is now a **MSc Drug Design** student at **University College London, United Kingdom** and he was an undergraduate student majoring in **Bioinformatics** at **Soochow University, China** during the period of 2018 and 2022. 

Under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. **Guang Hu** and Assoc. Prof. **Zhongjie Liang**, he is now focusing on how to integrate bioinformatics and biophysics methods to have an insight into protein dynamics, along with protein sequence, structure and function research and finally figure out how to use structural information for the construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction networks, paving the way for drug discovery. Also, supervised by Prof. **Bairong Shen** at **Institutes for Systems Genetics, West China Hospital**, he established a risk factor knowledgebase for neurodegenerative diseases ([NDDRF](http://sysbio.org.cn/NDDRF/index.html)) together with other group members.
